[Walk-through](https://app.castify.com/view/53eeb5ba-a407-4564-9f10-f2d439aed73e)

## Description

This is a social network API that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The application is tested using Insomnia Core. This application is a back-end application that uses a NoSQL database and doesn't have a front-end, which is why there is no deployed link.
